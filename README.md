   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial Launch: Institutional Core"
   git remote add origin [YOUR_REPO_URL]
   git push -u origin main
   ```
2. **Environment Variables**:
   Ensure your hosting environment (Vercel/Netlify) has the following:
   - `API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API Key.
   - `SUPABASE_URL`: Your project URL.
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your project anonymous key.

## 🔒 Security & Sovereignty
The system implements a **Double-Scrubbing Protocol**. All PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and exact fiscal amounts are masked or generalized before being sent to any neural inference nodes.
